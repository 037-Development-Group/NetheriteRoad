The restoration degree is over 80%, bringing the gospel to the players who want to get the Nether Alloy in version 1.12 but have no way to do so. The Nether Road has been continuously updated!

This mod is dedicated to restoring the nether metal equipment, tools, and armor elements of version 1.16 and above in version 1.12.2, such as nether alloy swords, nether alloy armor sets, ancient wreckage, nether alloy ingots and fragments, etc. Not only that, but also the pursuit of meticulous perfection, the armor, blocks, sound effects and item textures are 100% restored to the vanilla version, allowing players to experience the vanilla feeling.

Are you still worried that your craftsman's soul smelting furnace can't make the craftsman's soul's nether alloy equipment without the nether alloy? The ontology of the Nether Road can do it! The Nether Road is also a craftsman's soul linkage module, which can be smelted with molten gold and molten ancient wreckage into molten nether alloy, and then you can make various tools related to the nether alloy of the craftsman's soul.

The Road to the Nether is just an ontology, and we make various expansion packs to enrich the gameplay of the mod. If you have any suggestions, please give us feedback!
